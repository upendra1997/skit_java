What is the relationship between programming and classes present in your program.
	
	Usually there is no relationship between java program file name and classes present in this program only if there is no public class.
	If any class is public then name of this program should be same as this public class.
	Any program can contain only one public class
	After compilation a number of *.class file is creatd(which were present in the program).
	A program can cotain more than one main method. 
	But normally we save the program with the same name of the class present in the program, that's why normally we write one class in one program.
